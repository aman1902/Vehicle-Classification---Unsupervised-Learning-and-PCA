# Vehicle-Classification---Unsupervised-Learning-and-PCA
The project includes machine learning models that deal with classification. The data set involves data with features belonging to different types of cars. The project implements Data cleaning and pre-processing to clean the data. The models use different algorithms under supervised and unsupervised machine learning to predict the class of the vehicles. This project also takes into use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. In the end,  the model results are compared visually using graphs, plots and suggestions and recommendations are provided.
